## Week 1

### Project Research

1. Read articles on micro service architecture to understand more about requirement of the project
2. Research on MongoDB sharding techniques and partition tolerance properties
3. Learning Go language using Tour of go and other hands on tutorials
4. Exploring AWS lambda and amazon gateway and figuring out how different it is from using kong gateway 

Agile Core value -Simplicity

Trying to start with basics keeping simple design in mind as everyone is new to Go language,cloud techniques as well as microservice architecture style development.Decided to learn the foundation topics before diving into complex architecture

## Week 2

1.Team decided to go ahead with Bookstore app development
2.I choose to work on Inventory management API part using Mongo DB as the database
3.Spent more time on learning structure of Go programming
4.Tried some configuration changes on mongo cluster to tune availability levels
5.Read articles on good sharding techniques and criteria to choose sharding key in mongo

Agile Core value -Simplicity

This is still second week and team is yet to actually start coding in GO.So kept our achictecture design simple with a basic flow between API's.Team decided to develop basic go code first and check connectivity between our API's and then go ahead with further exception handling scenarios and concurrency control.

## Week 3

1.Discussed with team regarding the micro service architecture implementation
2.Decided UI theme for project and discussed basic UI flow to make sure of requirements
3.I took up payment screen to implement as part of UI development
4.Need to spend more time on understanding microservice API implementation
5.We decided to shard user transaction data based on user id

Agile Core value -Simplicity

While developing Go API we are trying to keep it as simple as possible since its our first attempt with GO and microservice architecture.Decided on simple UI design with minimalistic features required.Goal is to make app work end to end before diving into depth of concurrency in GO
