### Project Research
1. Made sure to understand all the requirements and scope for our idea

Tried to ensure that we are constantly communicating reviews of each other's work to make project better each week.

## Week 2

### Set up the mongodb cluster
1. Diving deep into the mongo cluster management

We made sure that cluster management techniques are proper for everyone discussing the strategies in meeting. Feedback helped us improve each other's work

## Week 3

### Set up Go and successfully communicate to mongodb
1. Set up all the APIs for transaction management in GO
2. Made all structs type required for model to insert data objects in mongodb
3. Resolved cors issue so that api can be accessed without any issue from other microservices.
4. Developed frontend in reactjs for transaction part
4. Now working on connecting to mongocluster instead of individual mongo node.

Agile Core value - Feedback <br>
We realised the continuous value of feedback this week while integrating apis. we realised that without effective feedback of work which we did individually, we could not successfully overcome the sync issues.
